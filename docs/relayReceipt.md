# Relay Receipt
A relay response includes the [relay transaction](./relayTransaction.md) and two additional fields: `receiptSignature` and `id`.

## Fields
```
{
  relayTransaction: RelayTransaction,
  id: string (bytes32),
  receiptSignature: string (bytes)
}
```

### id (bytes32)

The `id` is this [digest](https://github.com/PISAresearch/contracts.any.sender/blob/b13be3dff24989fd24783ae3d79104124a38b2fa/versions/0.3.0/contracts/core/RelayTxStruct.sol#L23). It is the same `id` which is signed by the `from` address making the relay transaction.

### receiptSignature (bytes)

The signature is generated by the [receipt signer](../README.md#addresses). It is the address registered as the signing authority in the Adjudicator.sol contract. See [guarantees](./guarantees.md) for more details. Upon receiving a response this signature should be validated by reconstructing the digest, recovering the signing address from signature and digest, then checking that this is equal to the [receipt signer address](../README.md#addresses).
